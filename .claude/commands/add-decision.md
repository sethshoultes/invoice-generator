Help me document a new architectural or technical decision in DECISIONS.md.

Ask me about:
1. What decision was made?
2. What was the context/problem we were solving?
3. What alternatives were considered?
4. Why did we choose this option?
5. What are the tradeoffs?

Then format this as a proper decision entry and append it to DECISIONS.md following the existing format:
- Decision number (increment from last)
- Date
- Status (Active)
- Decision summary
- Context
- Alternatives considered (with pros/cons)
- Rationale
- Tradeoffs
- Implementation details (if applicable)
- Related decisions/files
