Load the full project context by reading all memory system files in order:

1. First, read CLAUDE.md for project overview and instructions
2. Then read STATUS.md for current state
3. Then read ROADMAP.md for what's next
4. Then read DECISIONS.md for architectural decisions
5. Finally, read JOURNAL.md for learnings and patterns

After reading all files, provide a brief summary of:
- What this project is
- Current status and task
- Key decisions to be aware of
- What to work on next

This is the standard way to start a new development session.
