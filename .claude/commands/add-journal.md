Help me document a learning or discovery in JOURNAL.md.

Ask me about:
1. What did you discover or learn?
2. What was the problem or context?
3. What was the solution?
4. What code or pattern is involved?
5. What's the key takeaway for future reference?

Then format this as a journal entry and append it to JOURNAL.md following the existing format:
- Date and title
- Discovery section
- Problem/Context section
- Solution with code example (if applicable)
- Learning/Takeaway section
- Related links (decisions, files, docs)

Only add entries for meaningful discoveries, not routine implementations.
