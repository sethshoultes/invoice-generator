Update the STATUS.md file to reflect the current state of the project.

Ask me:
1. What task did we just complete or work on?
2. What's the current progress percentage?
3. Are there any blockers?
4. What should be the next steps?

Then update STATUS.md with:
- Updated "Last Updated" timestamp
- Current task and phase
- Recent progress (add new items, mark completed)
- Blockers (if any)
- Next steps

This should be done at the end of each development session.
